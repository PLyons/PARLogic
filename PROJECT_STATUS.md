# PARLogic Project Status

## Project Overview
PARLogic is a hospital supply chain management system that helps optimize inventory levels using PAR (Periodic Automatic Replenishment) calculations.

## Current Status (as of March 6, 2024)

### Completed Components

#### Backend (Task Group 5)
- ✅ FastAPI backend implementation
- ✅ Core endpoints for data operations
- ✅ CORS middleware and security features
- ✅ CSV ingestion functionality
- ✅ Usage analysis endpoints
- ✅ PAR calculation algorithms
- ✅ Inventory recommendations
- ✅ API documentation with Pydantic models
- ✅ API key authentication
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Test coverage for backend

#### Frontend (Task Group 6)
- ✅ React project setup with Material-UI
- ✅ Core component implementation
  - ✅ DashboardLayout
  - ✅ Dashboard
  - ✅ UploadData
  - ✅ Analysis
  - ✅ PARLevels
- ✅ Modern UI with Material-UI theme
- ✅ File upload functionality
- ✅ Usage visualization with Chart.js
- ✅ PAR calculations integration
- ✅ API integration

### Current Issues

#### Testing Environment (Task Group 7)
1. Development Server
   - ⚠️ Issue with date-fns dependency causing build errors
   - ⚠️ Vite configuration needs adjustment for proper module resolution

2. Cypress Setup
   - ✅ Successfully configured to run with Chrome from external drive
   - ⚠️ Test execution environment not fully stable
   - ⚠️ Tests currently failing due to application not rendering properly

### Action Items

#### Immediate Priority
1. Fix Development Server Issues
   - Resolve date-fns dependency conflict with @mui/x-date-pickers
   - Update Vite configuration for proper module resolution

2. Stabilize Testing Environment
   - Fix application rendering issues in test environment
   - Ensure consistent test execution

3. Complete E2E Tests
   - Verify upload functionality
   - Test analysis workflows
   - Validate PAR level calculations

#### Future Tasks
1. Performance Optimization
   - Implement caching for API calls
   - Optimize bundle size

2. Additional Features
   - Add export functionality for reports
   - Implement batch processing for large datasets

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- Node.js environment
- Python backend
- Vite development server
- Cypress for E2E testing

### Current Working Directories
- Frontend: `/frontend`
- Backend: `/backend`
- Tests: `/frontend/cypress/e2e`

## Next Steps
1. Fix the date-fns dependency issue
2. Complete the E2E test suite setup
3. Run and validate all tests
4. Document test coverage and results
5. Plan performance optimization phase

## Notes
- All code changes are tracked in Git
- Development is following the established task groups
- Testing framework is in place but needs stabilization
- Documentation is being maintained alongside development
